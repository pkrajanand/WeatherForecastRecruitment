Architectural Overview
------------------------------------

The application follows three-tire architecture:

* client side: including html pages and javascript files
* web tier: Restful controllers
* service tier: CityLoading Service and WeatherForeCasting service

Current implementation make use of a free service provided by Open Weather Map(http://openweathermap.org) for weather updates. But this could easily be replaced with another
implementation since the respective services are designed in a loosely coupled fashion.

Unit tests covers critical code regions.

Spring boot is used for quick turn around and to avail of an embedded tomcat deployment.
