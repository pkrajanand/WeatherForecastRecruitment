Architectural Overview
------------------------------------

The application follows three-tire architecture:

* client side: HTML page and AngularJS-based JavaScript file
* web tier: Restful controllers to collaborate between views and services
* service tier: Spring annotated services for loading the covered cities and for fetching the weather data for the selected city

Current implementation make use of a free service provided by Open Weather Map(http://openweathermap.org) for weather updates. But this could easily be replaced with another
implementation since the respective services are designed in a loosely coupled fashion.

Unit tests covers the core code regions.

Spring-Boot is used for quick turn around and to avail of an embedded Tomcat deployment.
